# Dabloon-Bank

A bank for your dabloons I made this a while ago.

## Installation
How to install the script into the terminal as a app or standard install
### Standard
This is assuming you have the latest version of python downloaded

1. Use the cd command to change to the directory where you want to install the game
2. Open terminal or powershell and type "git clone https://github.com/itzCozi/Dabloon-Bank.git"
3. After that type "python main.py" to run or make a terminal shim so you can use it in terminal or powershell

### Terminal App
NOTICE: You must have [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) installed to follow this

1. Open the scoop folder in C:/users/YOUR_USER/scoop
2. Then open the apps folder and add a new folder called "dabloon-bank"
3. After that download and extract all the files in the repository into the new directory
4. Now copy the path of that folder and put it somewhere (Notepad or notepadqq)
5. Then go back to the scoop folder and open "shims"
6. make a new file and name it "bank.cmd" or whatever you want the command name
7. Open the file and type without parentheses (@"THE_COPIED_PATH.py"  %*)
8. Then save the file and open terminal and type "bank" (Or whatever the .cmd is named) you should see the game
if not try again or make an issue                                                                             

## Usage
Once running the script you should see the interface and 3 options.
